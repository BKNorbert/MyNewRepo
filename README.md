It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words _italic_ or ~~striked~~ with Markdown. You can even [Link to Google!](http://google.com)

Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
1. Two
1. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

- Start a line with a star
- Profit!

If you want to embed images, this is how you do it:

```javascript
if (isAwesome) {
  return true;
}
```

| First Header | Second Header |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| Cell 1       | Cell 2        |
| Cell A       | Cell B        |

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3
